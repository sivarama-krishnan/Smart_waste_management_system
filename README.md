CODE Framework of the Smart Waste Management System Flowchart

1. Start

The process begins when a user accesses the system to engage in waste management tasks.

2. Login or Sign-Up

•	User Authentication: New users must sign up, while existing users can log in.

•	Role-Based Access: After login, users are categorized into either municipality workers or residents based on their responsibilities.

3. Municipality Workers' Section

Municipality workers are divided into Officials and Garbage Collectors, each with distinct responsibilities.

A. Officials' Responsibilities

1. Residents' Feedback Management

•	View complaints or remarks submitted by residents.

•	Update the status of reported issues (e.g., "Pending," "In Progress," "Resolved").

2. Schedule Management

•	View garbage collection schedules.

•	Modify and update schedules based on requirements (e.g., festival clean-up, emergency cleaning).

•	Track the overall progress of garbage collection efforts.

Purpose: Officials act as coordinators who manage waste collection, ensure proper scheduling, and respond to residents’ concerns.

B. Garbage Collectors' Responsibilities

1. Viewing Remarks & Updates

•	Check complaints or remarks made by residents or officials.

•	Get updates regarding assigned tasks.

2. Location Tracking

•	Their movement and work locations can be tracked to optimize efficiency.

3. Work Reporting & Remarks

•	Report on completed work.

•	Submit remarks about problems faced during collection (e.g., blocked roads, excessive waste).

Purpose: Garbage collectors ensure that the cleaning process is carried out effectively by following official schedules and addressing resident complaints.

4. Residents' Section

1. Uploading Complaints

•	Residents can upload images and remarks related to waste collection problems (e.g., overflowing bins, unattended waste).

2. Checking Status

•	Residents can track the status of their complaints, ensuring transparency in issue resolution.

3. Viewing & Updating Schedules

•	Residents can check current garbage collection schedules.

•	They can also receive updates when the schedule changes.

Purpose: Residents play an active role in ensuring their locality remains clean by reporting waste issues and staying informed about collection timings.

5. Log Out

Once tasks are completed, users can log out of the system to end their session.

6. Stop

The system stops functioning for that user session after logout.

 



•	This flowchart outlines a structured system that facilitates waste management by involving municipality workers (officials and garbage collectors) and residents. The system focuses on efficient waste collection, tracking progress, and addressing complaints or remarks made by residents.
